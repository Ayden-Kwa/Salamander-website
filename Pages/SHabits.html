    <p>Some species of salamander are aquatic throughout life, others take to the water for some time, and a few are <u>terrestrial</u> as adults.</p>
    <h3 class="colorblink">Terrestrial :living or growing on land </h3>
    <p>Salamanders have  very sensitive skin and many species breathe through it. 2/3 of all salamander species are lungless, instead, they breathe through their skin. A salamander's body absorbs oxygen, but it can also absorb other elements.</p>
    <p>One of the best things about salamanders is that most of them have the ability to regenerate body parts—including limbs, tails, eye tissue and even brain tissue. By learning how the salamanders’ macrophages are able to repair and regenerate so effectively, scientists can take what they learn and add it to human medicine. In future, what scientists learn could help those who have lost limbs.</p>
