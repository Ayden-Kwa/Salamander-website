<h2>Salamanders are usually more active during breezy times of the day and are nocturnal. During the day they lounge under rocks or in trees to stay cool. At night they come out to eat. Their bright, colorful skin warns predators to stay away.</h2>
<p>Salamanders can also protect themselves from predators by squeezing their muscles to make the needle-sharp tips of their ribs poke through their skin and into the foe. </p>
<p>The axolotl, a salamander that lives in water, can grow back limbs lost in fights with predators due to their special immune system.</p>
<h2>Salamanders are carnivores, which means they eat other animals. They like to eat prey that are slow, such as snails and slugs.</h2>
<p>Some bigger salamanders eat fish, small crustaceans and insects.</p>
<p>Some salamanders eat frogs, mice and sometimes even other salamanders.</p>
