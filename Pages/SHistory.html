        <p>Salamanders are amphibians that look lizard-like, with slimy bodies, small snouts, and both young and adults salamanders have tails .</p>
        <p>Salamanders rarely have more than four toes on their front legs and five on their rear legs, but some species lack hind limbs. Their skin usually makes them rely on habitats in or near water or other cool, wet places. </p>
        <p>The salamander represents: </p><h2>immortality,</h2><h2> being reborn,</h2><h2>passion,</h2><h2> and the ability to tolerate flames.(Isn't that weird?)</h2></h2><p>The symbol connects to Montag as a character who burned himself, literally and figuratively, in the pursuit of knowledge and happiness, yet came out unharmed on the other side.</p>
        <p>While the word salamander is Greek for “fire lizard,” and salamanders are fabled to not be affected by fire, they cannot actually tolerate flames any longer than we can.</p>
